# Swatches

**Various swatch collections.**

## Installation

From the command line, run:

```bash
curl -L https://git.io/vzonQ | sh
```

This will install all Adobe Swatch Exchange swatches from this repo into your `/Applications/Adobe\ Illustrator CC\ 20XX/Presets.localized/en_US/Swatches/` directory.

Restart Illustrator and open the swatches palette. From the palette fly-out menu, choose <kbd>Open Swatch Library</kbd> and pick a swatch palette from the `@mhulse` directory:

**Tip:** From an opened swatch library palette window, choose `Persistent` from the fly-out menu and dock the tab to your UI; next time Illustrator opens that palette will be loaded and visible.
